# Lending-Club-Estimation-Project
Using a subset of LendingClub DataSet, we aim to build a predictive model that determines if a borrower will repay their loan. By assessing historical data on loan defaults, the model will help evaluate potential customers' likelihood to repay. Model accuracy will be checked using metrics.
